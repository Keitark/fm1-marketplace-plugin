# FM1 Forge

FM1 Forge **3.0.1** is the renamed private FM1 App Library plugin. Its existing plugin ID,
Site URL and local bridge remain in use. Open the installed plugin's newest app
card in Codex's side panel. The primary interface is the native MCP App panel.

The current resource is `ui://fm1/forge-panel-v2.html`; older resource aliases
remain available. The final private Site deployment succeeded with MCP enabled.
The newest native card has not yet been expanded, and older expanded panels
remain cached App Library UI. Confirm the **FM1 Forge** header and module
designer in the newest card before treating the native view as current.

Diagnostics installation is still pending. Runtime elevation was canceled;
no new protected helper or firmware write resulted. A ready protected helper
and separately confirmed transfer are required before installing diagnostics.
Build/package checks do not qualify the candidate or hardware.

## First firmware

1. Refresh connection and packages. The local protected helper must be ready.
2. Choose **Review diagnostics install**, review the selected `factory-diag` package
   digest and automatic serial/UBOOT route, then confirm the displayed operation.
3. Follow the original saved job. Write, full readback and serial startup are
   recorded separately; reconnecting never resubmits the write.
4. Test the LCD, all 41 buttons/keys, seven encoders, master volume and audible
   key tones at FM1. UAC playback/capture and long-run stability need real tests.
5. After the service records the exact completed diagnostic baseline, select
   **New firmware project**, configure the graphical modules and **Ask Codex**.

The basic firmware is independent diagnostic software, not the vendor's stock
firmware. It contains no ROM, WAD, song or proprietary bank. The LCD displays
input states, coverage, encoder counts, volume and measured LCD frame rate.
Piano keys play a quiet triangle tone with short ramps and a two-second cap.
The source and offline LCD preview are in the FM1 repository's
`firmware/forge/README.md` and `firmware/forge/preview/diagnostics.png`.

## Module designer

The graph separates fixed USB/system recovery from shared HAL and editable user
code. CDC and UBOOT recovery remain enabled. USB Audio Class can be selected;
it provides stereo playback and digital synth capture rather than analog mic
capture or a flash protocol. HAL ABI1 exposes all inputs, LCD rendering, audio
and immutable health snapshots. User code has init/update/render/audio/shutdown
callbacks, with bounded IRQ audio work and output clipping.

Download the configuration as `<project-slug>.fm1-forge.json`; the generator
writes it as `forge.json` inside the new project. **Ask Codex** sends that reviewed
configuration and your brief through the host's supported message action. If
the host does not support it, the same prompt remains available to copy. The
action requests coding; it does not report a completed build or flash a device.

For this example, set **Project folder** to `first-synth` before downloading.
In the FM1 source checkout:

```powershell
python firmware/forge/create_project.py --base projects --slug first-synth --config first-synth.fm1-forge.json
python firmware/forge/build_project.py --project projects/first-synth --dry-run
python firmware/forge/build_project.py --project projects/first-synth
```

Creation refuses an existing project directory. Edit the generated `user.c`
and choose `module: "user"`. The build honors the selected module, USB audio,
clock and LCD presets and creates a new output folder. Packaging and an exact
offline transfer review follow a successful audited build.

## Display and clock settings

The panel defaults to opaque `#000000` with a plain background. Older version-1
appearance preferences migrate to that requested default once. Later selections
retain 13 palettes, five patterns and custom colours; they are local preferences
and send no device command.

LCD choices are maintained stock DMA, nominal 15 MHz packed RGB444 and nominal
30 MHz packed RGB444. Faster presets require the expected bus clock, retain
async DMA ownership, and expose actual frame rate and error counters.

`sdk-default` preserves boot clocks. `sdk-320` is experimental and requires exact
clock/bus readback before USB or DMA starts. It is not proven faster than the
default clock. No unsupported 396/480 MHz setter is offered. Test each nondefault
profile on the device before relying on timing or claiming higher FPS.

The pinned SDK's real setter is `system_clock_set`; `clk_set` is a stub. The
320 MHz table reports a 53 MHz LSB. The panel and generator therefore reject
320 MHz combined with the 15/30 MHz LCD presets, which require a 60 MHz LSB.
Use stock DMA with 320 MHz, or SDK-default CPU with the faster LCD choices.

## Transfer methods and recovery

- **Auto/serial:** identify the normal CDC firmware and explicitly quiesce its
  runtime before entering UBOOT; the protected UBOOT writer installs the package.
- **Already UBOOT:** use the same protected application writer directly.
- **Official SysEx:** review a handoff to the locally pinned vendor updater,
  which accepts official `.fwsc` packages and handles MIDI/OTA transitions.

Custom Forge packages are stock-layout application containers, not vendor
`.fwsc` files. Direct CDC COMMIT remains blocked. A vendor updater opening is
not a verified firmware update. Preserve unknown jobs, stopped snapshots and
verified rollback receipts; inspect their exact IDs before another operation.

The current module action unlocks from authoritative saved diagnostic transfer
proof, not a browser preference, app card or simulated preview. Physical control,
sound and screen acceptance remains a device observation.
